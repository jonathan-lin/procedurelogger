# procedurelogger
Requirements: 
1. chrome or firefox client that works with Selenium. I use geckodriver. Edit the location of the webdriver in the procedurelogger.py script
2. Formatted excel spreadsheet (template provided). Edit the location of the spreadsheet in the procedurelogger.py script

Notes:
After running the script, be sure to verify that data was entered correctly and then change column 9 in the excel spreadsheet to read "yes" instead of "no"
